# Project Structure Reference Rule

@docs/project_structure.md

## Always Check Project Structure Documentation Before Making Changes

Before making any changes to the project structure or functionality, you MUST review the project structure documentation. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of:

1. The entire project organization and component relationships
2. Purpose and functionality of each module and file
3. Usage patterns and examples for different components
4. Dependencies between different parts of the system

This rule ensures that all modifications maintain consistency with the existing architecture and design principles.

## Guidelines

- Any new files or directories should follow the established naming conventions
- New functionality should be placed in the appropriate modules
- When modifying existing code, ensure the changes align with the component's documented purpose
- When suggesting changes that affect multiple components, refer to the structure document for dependency identification

## Important Areas to Check

- Core calculator logic in `src/calculator.py` and `src/advanced_calculator/main.py`
- Specialized calculation modules in `src/advanced_calculator/modules/`
- Web interface in `src/advanced_calculator/web/`
- Template files in `templates/`
