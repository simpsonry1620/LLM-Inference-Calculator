# End-of-Day Tasks Checklist for AI Assistant

Before committing and pushing changes to the repository, please perform the following tasks systematically:

## 1. Code Quality Checks

-   [x] **Linting:** Run the project's linter (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`, `ruff check .`) across all modified files and directories. Fix any reported errors or warnings. *(Remaining issues moved to ISSUES.md)*
-   [x] **Formatting:** Ensure code formatting adheres to project standards (e.g., run `black .`, `ruff format .`).

## 2. Testing

-   [x] **Run Unit Tests:** Execute the full suite of unit tests (e.g., `pytest`). Ensure all tests pass. Investigate and fix any failures.
-   [x] **Run Integration Tests (if applicable):** Execute any integration tests to verify interactions between components. *(N/A - No specific integration tests identified)*

## 3. Documentation Review

-   [x] **Update Docstrings:** Review and update docstrings for any new or modified functions, classes, or modules.
-   [x] **Update docs/*.md files:** Check if the main `README.md` a other documentation files (`docs/`) need updates to reflect the changes made (e.g., new features, usage instructions, dependency changes).
-   [x] **Update README.md :** Check if the main `README.md` reflect the changes made (e.g., new features, usage instructions, dependency changes).
-   [x] **Check `CHANGELOG.md` (if applicable):** Add an entry summarizing the changes for the next release. *(N/A - No CHANGELOG.md found)*

## 4. Git Operations

-   [x] **Review Changes:** Use `git status` and `git diff --staged` to review the changes one last time. Ensure only intended changes are staged.
-   [ ] **Craft Commit Message:** Write a clear, concise, and informative commit message following project conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits). The message should summarize *what* was changed and *why*.
-   [ ] **Commit:** Perform the `git commit`.
-   [ ] **Pull Latest Changes:** Run `git pull origin <your-branch>` to fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote repository, resolving any conflicts. Re-run tests if necessary after merging.
-   [ ] **Push:** Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <your-branch>`.

## 5. Final Verification (Optional)

-   [ ] **Check CI/CD Pipeline:** If applicable, monitor the continuous integration pipeline to ensure the build and tests pass successfully after pushing.
